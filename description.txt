########## FDL21: FDL-DSBA ##########
Segment features around residential buildings in UAV images of flooded area taken in Houston after Hurrican Harvey.

For the purpose of the FDL course you will have to implement and solve a remote sensing problem using recent deep learning techniques. In particular, the main objective of this challenge is to segment images acquired by a small UAV (sUAV) at the area on Houston, Texas. These images were acquired in order to assess the damages on residential and public properties after Hurricane Harvey. In total there are 25 categories of segments (e.g. roof, trees, pools etc.).

The task is to design and implement a deep learning model in order to perform the automatic segmentation of such images. The model can be trained using the train images which contain pixel-wise annotations. Using the trained model, a prediction on the test images should be performed and submitted on the platform. Depending on the performance of the submitted file and the leaderboard you will be ranked accordingly using macro F1 score.

Following classes are present:
0: Background
1: Property Roof
2: Secondary Structure
3: Swimming Pool
4: Vehicle
5: Grass
6: Trees / Shrubs
7: Solar Panels
8: Chimney
9: Street Light
10: Window
11: Satellite Antenna
12: Garbage Bins
13: Trampoline
14: Road/Highway
15: Under Construction / In Progress Status
16: Power Lines & Cables
17: Water Tank / Oil Tank
18: Parking Area - Commercial
19: Sports Complex / Arena
20: Industrial Site
21: Dense Vegetation / Forest
22: Water Body
23: Flooded
24: Boat


EVALUATION:

This competition is evaluated on the mean Dice coefficient. The Dice coefficient can be used to compare the pixel-wise agreement between a predicted segmentation and its corresponding ground truth. The Dice coefficient is defined to be 1 when both X and Y are empty. The leaderboard score is the mean of the Dice coefficients for each (Image, Label) pair in the test set.

SUBMISSION FORMAT:

In order to reduce the submission file size, our metric uses run-length encoding on the pixel values for a particular class. Instead of submitting an exhaustive list of indices for your segmentation, you will submit pairs of values that contain a start position and a run length. E.g. '1 3' implies starting at pixel 1 and running a total of 3 pixels (1,2,3).

The competition format requires a space delimited list of pairs. For example, '1 3 10 5' implies pixels 1,2,3,10,11,12,13,14 are to be included in the mask. The metric checks that the pairs are sorted, positive, and the decoded pixel values are not duplicated. The pixels are numbered from top to bottom, then left to right: 1 is pixel (1,1), 2 is pixel (2,1), etc.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:
img_class,rle_mask
3692_15,1 1
3692_16,181 11
